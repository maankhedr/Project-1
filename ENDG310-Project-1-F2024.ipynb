    "## Loading and Visualizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due Friday, October 25th at 5pm via github\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will create an **interactive** visual graphic of data from a **two** datasets of your choosing.  Each dataset may be of any topic, however, it must meet the following criteria:\n",
    "- Come from a trustworthy and verifiable public source.\n",
    "- Be properly cited in your project.\n",
    "- Contain at least two columns of data and consist of at least 500 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this data, you need to create a visual that summarizes the data, presents a relationship between the two data sets, and presents some insight.  Simply plotting the data is not sufficient - you must manipulate the data to derive additional information (a running average, a trendline, annotations, etc).  The visual must be easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of datasets:\n",
    "- hourly CO2 data from Mauna Loa\n",
    "- hourly weather data showing seasonal and annual trends\n",
    "- global and Canadian wildfires\n",
    "- electricity production and demand data for Alberta from AESO\n",
    "- national and/or local statistics for COVID-19\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below is an example of a potential graphic which shows atmospheric CO2 data since 1980 and then overlays Jan-June 2020 data over it to show the impact of the pandemic on global CO2 levels.  This example only uses one dataset.  For full marks, you must include information from a second dataset (for example, the total number of airline flights or airline miles per day).\n",

    "## Requirements\n",
    "- You may use .py files, however, you must must use an annotated Notebook to explain your workflow.\n",
    "- Your final submission must be uploaded to git.\n",
    "- Your final graphic should have at least two subplots / subfigures and have at least four different data series.  \n",
    "- Plots should be well labeled and clear.\n",
    "- You may use any online resource for inspiration, however, you must cite all sources used outside of the course notes and Think Python textbook.\n",
    "- Your infographic must be animated (with motion) and have interactivity for full marks.\n",
    "- If you use ChatGPT, you must include the fundamental inputs used to generate output in ChatGPT as part of your `.ipynb` file.\n",
    "- The `README.md` file should be populated with a basic description of your project (ie, visual abstract).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubric\n",
    "To get a 80/100 on this project, you must:\n",
    "- Use at least one dataset (properly cited)\n",
    "- Create a static figure (jpg or png) summarizing the data and providing insight\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an 90/100 on this project, you must, in addition to the requirements above:\n",
    "- Use two datasets (properly cited)\n",
    "- Show an insightful relationship between the two datasets in a static figure\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an 1000/100 on this project, you must, in addition to the requirements above:\n",
    "- Use animations in the figure and include basic interactivity (for example, a tooltip that appears when a cursor hovers over a line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice to have ... not required but urge you to explore it\n",
    "- Include use interactivity where user interaction materially changes the content displayed (for example, clicking on a section of a piechart updates other plots to include information about that section of the piechart)"
